## $$\text{\color{lightblue}Projects}$$
### Human Emotion Recognition |<sub> https://github.com/mmparvez/project_4.git </sub>
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify human emotions based on facial expressions. Additionally, a second model has also been trained, for recognising if an image is a human face or not, for potential use in conjunction with the initial emotion recognition model.
The design of the project, coding, model design and optimization of the Convolutional Neural Network model, training and testing the model was done.
All code was written in python, stored all images in google drive and a google colab notebook to run the code. Besides TensorFlow layers were used to design the Convolutional Neural Network model

### Citi Bike Trip Data Visualization |<sub> https://public.tableau.com/views/Week-18TableauChallenge/PopStn?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link </sub>
This was a visualization and insight finding project of the trip data of the New York Citi Bike Program. The goal of the project was to build skills of creating a dashboard and a story of the insights in Tableau.
The data sets were collected from source and loaded on Tableau after the ETL process. After intense observation on the data table some facts were found to visualize which creates a scope to deeper analysis. Three dashboards with interactive maps and charts and a story were created on fact finding steps.
A python code was written to Extract Transform and Load the data and Tableau to analyze and visualize.

### Earthquake on World Map |<sub> https://github.com/mmparvez/leaflet-challenge.git</sub>
Visualizing an important natural phenomenon on a world map was the main goal of the project. In addition to finding any insight or hidden fact on the Earthquake data.
The USGS is a very good source of the GeoJSON data of world earthquake history. A html and a supporting JavaScript were created to read the earthquake data and plot bubble markers on the location of the quake in a world map. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. A map layer was also added to show the tectonic plates. 
Leaflet, HTM and JavaScript were used for the project.

### Web Design | <sub>https://github.com/mmparvez/Web-Design-Challenge.git</sub>
Creating an interactive webpage from scratch was the goal of the project.
A landing page was created in addition to Seven HTML pages linked to the landing page. Each page shows changes of maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed with the changes of latitude of a certain day. The plots of each feature with the latitude of the locations were shown on each page of my webpages.There was a data table in a separate page as well.
Python, Matplotlib, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap were used in the project. <br />
