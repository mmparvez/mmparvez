## $$\text{\color{lightblue}Projects}$$
### Human Emotion Recognition |<sub> https://github.com/mmparvez/project_4.git </sub>
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify human emotions based on facial expressions. Additionally, a second model has also been trained, for recognising if an image is a human face or not, for potential use in conjunction with the initial emotion recognition model.
I did all the project design, coding, preparing and optimizing the Convolutional Neural Network model, training the model and testing the model.
I wrote the code in python, used google drive to store all images and google colab notebook to run the code. Besides I designed the CNN model using TensorFlow layers.

### Citi Bike Trip Data Visualization |<sub> https://public.tableau.com/views/Week-18TableauChallenge/PopStn?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link </sub>
This was a visualization and insight finding project of the trip data of the New York Citi Bike Program. The goal of the project was to build skills of creating a dashboard and a story of the insights in Tableau.
I have collected the data sets from source and loaded it on Tableau after the ETL process. After intense observation on the data table I found some facts to visualize and a scope to deeper analysis. I had created three dashboards with interactive maps and charts and a story of fact finding steps.
I used python on ETL process and Tableau for the analysis and visualizations.

### Earthquake on World Map |<sub> https://github.com/mmparvez/leaflet-challenge.git</sub>
Visualizing an important natural phenomenon on a world map was the main goal of the project. In addition to finding any insight or hidden fact on the Earthquake data.
The USGS is a very good source of the GeoJSON data of world earthquake history. I wrote a html and a supporting JavaScript to read the earthquake data and plot bubble markers on the location of the quake in a world map. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Also I created a map layer to show the tectonic plates.I used Leaflet, HTM and JavaScript for the project.
I used Leaflet, HTM and JavaScript for the project.

### Web Design | <sub>https://github.com/mmparvez/Web-Design-Challenge.git</sub>
Creating an interactive webpage from scratch was the goal of the project.
I have created seven HTML pages linked to the landing page. Each page shows changes of maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed with the changes of latitude of a certain day. First I collect the weather data of different important cities in the world of that day. Then I find the Geolocation of the cities and plot them in scatter plots with latitude. These plots were shown on each page of my webpages. Also I showed the data table in a separate page.
Python, Matplotlib, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. <br />
